/**
 * Status — embeds the polished gate board (`/_audit/run.html`) full-bleed.
 * Behavior (documented for operators):
 * - First load of the iframe auto-runs every fast gate in sequence.
 * - Storybook navigation that keeps the iframe cached does not silently re-run;
 *   use the board's **Re-run** control for a fresh pass.
 * - Doctrine: VERSION pinned 1.0.0; no CHANGELOG.md — see Release Notes for product prose.
