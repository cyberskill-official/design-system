# Release Notes

Curated product highlights for operators. This is **not** a git log and **not** a `CHANGELOG.md` — the design system does not maintain a changelog file. Version stays pinned at **1.0.0**; technical continuity is the repo tip, and product-facing continuity is this page (mirrored in Storybook **Release Notes**).

## `@cyberskill/design@1.0.0` on npm (Trusted Publishing)

The package is live on the npm registry as **`@cyberskill/design@1.0.0`**. CI publishes via **npm Trusted Publishing (OIDC)** — no long-lived publish token. Package Publishing access on npmjs **disallows tokens** (OIDC still works; classic / granular publish tokens are rejected).

Approved use for CyberSkill portfolio products is recorded in **`docs/consumer-grant.md`** (+ VI). The package remains **UNLICENSED**; registry install alone is not a public license. Copy-paste first install for a locked product (Lumi · Hỏa · plasma): `examples/npm-hello/` — see `docs/consuming.md`.

```bash
npm install @cyberskill/design@1.0.0
```

## Storybook at the domain root

`design.cyberskill.world/` is the full Storybook product site. Docs, Foundations, Components, Release Notes, and Status live in one sidebar. Legacy `/dashboard` and `/playground` paths redirect to `/`.

Portable consumers are unchanged: `styles.css`, `_ds_bundle.js`, and `_esm/cs.mjs` remain the adoption paths. Storybook is host-only tooling.

## Quality gates on Status

The **Status** story embeds the fast gate board (`_audit/run.html`). Hard gates fail the board when broken; advisory rows are labelled clearly and do not flip the aggregate pass. Open Status once to auto-run; use **Re-run** for a fresh pass.

## Bilingual docs and templates

Public operator docs ship EN·VI pairs under `docs/` / `docs/vi/`. Templates remain bilingual EN·VN with fully separated language modes. Component strings resolve from the central registry.

## Foundations and CSF library

Theme × Element × Language toolbar globals mirror production templates. Every public primary ships a Default story plus an honest control matrix. Foundations cover colors, typography, spacing, elevation, motion, and the 15 Ngũ Hành element packs.

## Tokens and native mirrors

CSS tokens, DTCG (`tokens/tokens.dtcg.json`), and pre-generated SwiftUI / Compose / Flutter mirrors stay in lockstep via the token pipeline. Text never sits on mid-tone `-accent` — APCA doctrine is gate-enforced.

## What we never ship

- A root **`CHANGELOG.md`** (forbidden by doctrine and docs-consistency)
- A VERSION bump without an explicit owner decision
- Storybook as a consumer dependency
