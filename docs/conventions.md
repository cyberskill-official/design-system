# Conventions — authoring the CyberSkill DS

For humans and agents *extending this system*. (Consumers: read `SKILL.md`.) The compiler is the source of truth for counts; prose describes shape, never numbers.

## The expansion rule

**When anything grows, everything updates in the same change.** A new element/variant, icon, component, token role, language, or template pattern must propagate to: tokens/source → specimen cards (guidelines + the component group card) **and related guideline pages** → component contract trio (`.jsx` + `.d.ts` + `.prompt.md`) → **all** templates (tweak enums and maps) → Storybook Live / Identity Lab → docs (README counts, SKILL, **and every related document the change touches** — kit READMEs, registry, contrast report regenerated after token changes). **Do not bump `VERSION` and do not maintain a changelog file** — version stays at 1.0.0. Continuity is git history plus curated **Release Notes** (`docs/release-notes.md` / Storybook). Gate every expansion with the compiler check **and a grep for the old enum/list** — nothing ships half-propagated. Documented scope boundaries (doctrine, not gaps): UI-kit pages stay pixel-faithful Thổ recreations (axes demoed in Storybook Live and Identity Lab); every template is bilingual EN·VN and English-default (client/media collateral stays English-primary), and language variants render **fully separated** — see the decision log.

## The three axes

Every rendered surface resolves three orthogonal scopes — never encode one axis inside another:
| Axis | Attribute | Owns | Packs live in |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Theme** | `data-theme="dark\|system"` | light/dark inversion | `tokens/colors.css` |
| **Element** (Ngũ Hành) | `data-cs-element` + `data-cs-variant` | hue identity per product | `tokens/elements.css` |
| **Language** | `lang` / Language tweak | EN · VI copy | component registry + template props |

Surface treatment is liquid-glass (fixed). Immutable under all axes: Umber/Ochre anchors, voice, type families, semantic status colors, the 3px Ochre focus ring, APCA floors, ≥44px targets.

## Naming grammar

- Tokens: `--cs-<layer>-<role>[-<state>]` (`--cs-color-text-muted`). Element role layer: `--cs-accent-*` (9-token contract — see `tokens/elements.css` header).

- Classes: `.cs-<block>[-<part>][--modifier]`. Data attributes: `data-theme`, `data-cs-element`, `data-cs-variant`.

- Files: `tokens/<concern>.css` · `base/<concern>.css` (concern names, never changelog names — "interaction", not "refinements2") · `components/<group>/<Name>.{jsx,d.ts,prompt.md}` · `templates/<dept>-<artifact>/` · `guidelines/<group>-<topic>.html`.

- Template display names: `<Group> · <Artifact>` ("Finance · Invoice").

## Checklists

**New component** — `Name.jsx` + `Name.d.ts` + `Name.prompt.md` in `components/<group>/`; add to the group's card html (resolve the bundle namespace **by prefix** — `const CS = window[Object.keys(window).find(k=>/^CyberSkillDesignSystem_[0-9a-f]{6}$/.test(k))]` — never a hardcoded `…_<projectId>` suffix); add to readme's group line. Consume tokens only; no hex literals except inside `tokens/`.

**Responsive** — reflow is global (`base/responsive.css`, loaded last): media never overflows, print docs relax padding, `.cs-sheet` tables scroll, `.cs-sidebar` collapses, inline fixed-column grids collapse (3+→2 tablet, →1 phone), unbreakable long tokens (write-on `______` lines, long URLs/IDs) get `overflow-wrap: anywhere` on doc surfaces so they can't prop a phone column open, the app-shell shell grid collapses to one column with `main{min-width:0}`+`.cs-table-wrap` scroll, and fixed-geometry export canvases (`class="cs-canvas-desk"`: decks, social) **always** `overflow-x:auto` so a slide wider than the window scrolls inside the desk rather than pushing the page wide. Verified whole-set at 390 by `_audit/responsive-overflow.html` (all 84 = 0 document overflow). **Two hard gotchas:** (1) the DC runtime compiles inline `style="…"` into React objects, so the rendered attribute is *spaced* — any `[style*=…]` responsive selector must match `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)` (colon-space, comma-space), never the authored no-space form; (2) a global CSS rule can only override a property the template sets **inline** via an **attribute** selector (`[style*="grid-template-columns: 248px 1fr"]`) — a **class** selector loses to the inline style. Prefer fixing overflow in the template source (add `min-width:0`, `flex-wrap:wrap` inline) over fighting inline from the stylesheet.

**New template** — `templates/<slug>/<Slug>.dc.html` with `<!-- @template name description -->` first; `ds-base.js` stays single-entry (`styles.css` only — the one-line rebind was validated end-to-end Jul 2026 from a deeper path; the test scaffold has since been removed) and publishes the id-independent `window.CyberSkillDS` alias on bundle load, so mount DS components via `component-from-global-scope="CyberSkillDS.…"` — **never** a hardcoded `CyberSkillDesignSystem_<projectId>` suffix (it changes on re-import; enforced by `_audit/namespace-portability.html`); inline styles only; 1–3 tweaks (never plain copy/color — in-place editing covers those); printable docs add the `@page` + `.cs-desk`/`.cs-sheet` print block and carry **no dark tweak** (print is light-only).

**New element variant** — stay inside the element's oklch envelope; set the 9 `--cs-accent-*` contract tokens plus `--cs-color-text-accent`/`--cs-color-link` (APCA-check both); the aurora wash inherits from the element via `.cs-aurora-wash` (override the class rule only if the variant truly needs its own image); gradient partner (`grad-b`) must follow Tương sinh.

**Ship check** — run the compiler check until clean, then run `_audit/docs-consistency.html` **and** `_audit/namespace-portability.html` (both must be green). Version stays pinned at 1.0.0.

## Decision log (owner-approved)

- Elements fully replace Ochre inside product scopes; plasma's hot-pink edge approved (Jul 2026).

- Axes are Theme × Element × Language only. Surface treatment is liquid-glass (fixed).

- Product registry is provisional ("decide for me", Jul 2026) until a real product list exists.

- Text never sits on the mid-tone `-accent` — codified after the APCA sweep (see `docs/contrast-report.md`).

- Language variants render **fully separated**: switching the Language tweak yields a complete single-language artifact — no partial translation left in headings, labels, helper text, footers, or body. The only bilingual-by-design elements are the CyberSkill name + slogan lockup (`Hiện Thực Hoá Ý Chí · Turn Your Will Into Real`, the canonical form — never a lone half) and the A4 legal identity block (company legal name + state motto). Everything else swaps with the tweak (Jul 2026).

- **Namespace is resolved, never hardcoded** — the compiler names the bundle global `window.CyberSkillDesignSystem_<projectId>`, and that 6-hex suffix is derived from the project id, so it changes whenever the system is imported into another project. Templates read the stable `window.CyberSkillDS` alias that `ds-base.js` publishes on bundle load; cards, UI-kit pages, the standalone email, and audit harnesses resolve by prefix (`window[Object.keys(window).find(k=>/^CyberSkillDesignSystem_[0-9a-f]{6}$/.test(k))]`). `_ds_bundle.js`/`_ds_manifest.json` and the frozen `_audit/exports/` snapshot legitimately carry the real suffix (they *define* it). Enforced by `_audit/namespace-portability.html`, which scans every manifest-indexed source — keeps re-import **zero-touch** (Jul 2026).

- Verification uses the `_audit/` dev harnesses (see `_audit/README.md`): `responsive-harness.html` (the user-facing Responsive preview — **every** template at 390/768/1280), `responsive-overflow.html` (whole-set horizontal-overflow gate at 390 — **use a fresh iframe per template; reusing one races the `@import` CSS and gives false positives**), and `vn-overflow.html` (forces VN across every template, measures clipping). Force states from a frame's own context: `__dcSetProps(__dcRootName(), {language:"Tiếng Việt"})`, theme via `postMessage({type:"__dc_theme",theme:"dark"})`. `_audit/` is dev-only — not compiled, not a card. Never pass a value to `TextField` as **children** (crashes React #137 on re-render — the input is a void element); use `default-value` (Jul 2026).

## Export paths (per archetype)

Every template exports; the right path depends on the archetype. All paths preserve Vietnamese Unicode (verified by unzipping PPTX slide XML and probing the standalone bundle — VN diacritics survive as native text, see `_audit/exports/`).
| Archetype | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Deck (`*-deck`, `slide-deck`) | **PPTX (editable)** | `gen_pptx` at 960×540; force VN per-slide with `showJs: __dcSetProps(__dcRootName(),{language:'Tiếng Việt'})`. Text exports as native runs; only the Logo is an image. |
| Document (any with `@page{size:…}`) | **One-click PDF** | All 61 doc templates carry `<meta name="omelette-owns-print">` in the raw `<head>`, so the browser print engine paginates them at A4/Letter with the `@media print` chrome-strip. Print CSS is `@media screen`-scoped elsewhere so screen reflow never leaks onto paper. |
| Email / product page / any DC | **Standalone offline HTML** | The DC loads CSS + bundle dynamically via `ds-base.js`, which `super_inline_html` can't see. To bundle: make a `*-standalone.html` copy **in the same folder** (keeps `./support.js` relative) with **static** `<link rel="stylesheet" href="../../styles.css">` + `<script src="../../_ds_bundle.js">` in the raw `<head>` (both inlinable) instead of `ds-base.js`, plus a `<template id="__bundler_thumbnail">`. Bake the target language into the props default. Then `super_inline_html`. |
| Any | **Editor-native + Claude Code handoff** | The whole project is dev-handoff-ready (compiled bundle + `.d.ts` + `prompt.md` per component); generate the package on request via the handoff skill. |

**Font behavior on export.** Brand fonts are self-hosted (`Be Vietnam Pro` UI, mono). PPTX keeps the brand-font **names** but does not embed the files — on a machine without them PowerPoint substitutes a fallback (VN Unicode text is preserved; shapes may reflow slightly). For a fully self-contained hand-off, either tell the recipient to install the fonts, or export with a web-safe swap (`fontSwaps:[{from:'Be Vietnam Pro',to:'Arial'}]` — Arial covers Vietnamese). Standalone HTML **embeds** the fonts (inlined `@font-face` from `styles.css`), so it is always faithful offline (Jul 2026).

## Accessibility (base/a11y.css + component ARIA)

- **Focus rings are systematic** — global `:where(:focus-visible)` ochre ring in `base/reset.css`, plus per-component 3px ochre rings (`components/forms/navigation/controls`). Never set `outline: none` on a `:focus-visible` state without replacing the ring (the menu-item regression, fixed Jul 2026). The soft 5px glow in `interaction.css` layers on the 3px ring, never replaces it.

- **Touch targets** — `base/a11y.css` guarantees 44px on `@media (pointer: coarse)` (tabs, pagination, menu items, stepper, checkbox/radio; segmented 40px in its padded track). Desktop mouse density is preserved. `pointer: coarse` is used deliberately over a width breakpoint — a touch laptop at 1280px still needs 44px. Button carries its own coarse block in `components.css`.

- **Reduced motion** — `base/a11y.css` honours `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` globally (near-zero animation/transition durations); component-level exceptions (spinner slow-spin, status pulse off) already existed.

- **Screen-reader language** — every bilingual template carries a root `lang`: the 37 Vietnamese instruments (`vn-*`) are static `lang="vi"`; the 44 tweakable bilingual templates bind `lang="{{ langAttr }}"` to the Language tweak (`langAttr = language === "Tiếng Việt" ? "vi" : "en"`, injected into `renderVals`). Dual-block templates additionally wrap each `sc-if isVN` block in `<div lang="vi" style="display:contents">` (layout-neutral) so VN text is marked `vi` even in **Both** mode where the root is the primary `en`. Result: correct pronunciation in every language mode.

- **Component ARIA is complete** — every interactive component ships correct roles/labels (Button `aria-busy`; TextField/Textarea `aria-invalid`+`aria-describedby`+`role=alert`; Switch `role=switch`; SearchField `role=searchbox`; Menu `aria-haspopup`/`aria-expanded`/`role=menu(item)`; Pagination `nav`+`aria-current`+prev/next labels; Dialog/Drawer `aria-modal`; Toast `role=status`/`region`; ConfidenceMeter `role=meter`; Accordion `aria-expanded`; Logo `role=img`/`aria-hidden`). Preserve these when composing.

- **Void-element API rule** — components that render a void element (`<input>`/`<hr>`: TextField, Checkbox, Radio, Switch, SearchField, NumberField, Slider, Divider) destructure `children` out of `...props` so a stray child can never spread onto the void element (that crashes React with #137, the bug that hit `settings`). Content always comes from explicit props (`label` / `value` / `defaultValue`), never `children`. Follow this when adding any input-based component (Jul 2026).

- **Dark-theme contrast** — all text/surface pairings pass WCAG AA body (9–15:1). Semantic colours have dark overrides (`success #4ADE80`, `danger #F87171`, `warning #FBBF24`, `info #7CB2FB`) because the light-theme semantics failed on dark surfaces (~2.5:1); verify any new semantic pairing on `#221710`/`#2b1e14` (`_audit/` contrast math). The dark hairline border is intentionally subtle (separator, not a 3:1 boundary) (Jul 2026). **Interactive components that set `color`/`border-color: var(--cs-color-brand-umber)` on a themeable surface** (nav-item active, secondary/tertiary/ghost buttons, and the like) MUST ship a `[data-theme="dark"]` override — umber is near-invisible on dark; remap to ochre (emphasis) or `--cs-color-text-primary` (body). Screen-template brand wordmarks use `--cs-color-text-primary` (never hardcoded umber) so they flip in dark; print-doc headers stay umber by design. Table ID/code columns (e.g. `R-26-07`) carry `white-space:nowrap` so a hyphenated code never word-breaks in a narrow column (Jul 2026, user-reported). The umber-on-themeable-surface rule is now **enforced deterministically** by `_audit/contrast-guard.html` (static source lint + a token-pair WCAG matrix scored in light *and* dark) — the reliable gate the DOM-walk theme advisory couldn't be (v2.21.0). Note: `accent-strong` (the "accent text on light" role) is APCA-validated but WCAG-borderline (~3.2–4.3) for a few element packs (tho, tho/sand, thuy/mist, moc/bamboo) — reserve it for semibold/large accent text; the guard lists these as advisory and gates only egregious <3.0 (v2.21.1).

## RTL readiness (confirmed Jul 2026)

The system is **RTL-ready** — `base/*.css` is authored almost entirely in CSS **logical properties** (`inline-start`/`inline-end`, `margin-inline`, `padding-block`, `border-inline-*`, `inset-inline-*`), so setting `dir="rtl"` mirrors layouts automatically. Verified by rendering the kitchen-sink at `dir="rtl"` — nav, buttons, right-aligned labels, and mirrored fields/error text all flip correctly. The only physical props left are intentionally direction-agnostic: the dialog's `left:50%`+`translateX(-50%)` centering (symmetric) and the spinner's `border-right-color` (a rotating visual detail). Keep new CSS logical; reserve physical `left`/`right` for genuinely symmetric centering only. (Vietnamese is LTR, so RTL isn't shipped in templates — but the foundation is there for an Arabic/Hebrew tenant.)

## Real imagery (image-slot retrofit)

Templates lean on the `.cs-aurora-wash` gradients by default; to accept **real** photography, drop `<image-slot>` in. Load the component once per template via the helmet (`<script src="../../image-slot.js"></script>` — path relative to the template) and place `<image-slot id="…" shape="rect" style="position:absolute;inset:0;z-index:0">` as the **first** child of a `position:relative` hero, then layer `.cs-aurora-wash` (z-index:1, `pointer-events:none`) and a warm umber scrim (`linear-gradient(90deg,rgba(42,26,13,.86),rgba(42,26,13,.34))`, z-index:1, `pointer-events:none`) above it, with the content at z-index:2. The scrim keeps the empty drop-tile subtle and copy legible over any photo. Verified in `marketing-case-study`; the same 4-line pattern fits `marketing-page`, `marketing-social-kit`, `culture-event-invite`, and an `article` hero (each on request). Standalone reference: `templates/image-slots-demo.html`. Slots persist via a sibling sidecar (Jul 2026).

## Vietnamese typography & locale (verified Jul 2026)

Vietnamese is the primary language; the type system is built for it — verified, no changes needed:
- **Line-heights are VN-safe** — tokens body 1.5 / heading 1.35 / tight 1.15 leave room for stacked diacritics (dấu on top + nặng below). `:where(h1–h6)` defaults to 1.35 + `text-wrap: balance`; `:where(p)` gets `text-wrap: pretty` (both `base/reset.css`). Templates may hardcode a tighter line-height (≈1.0–1.15) **only** on single-line hero display headings; multi-line VN headings keep ≥1.15.

- **Locale formatting** — each language renders its own conventions: **VN** uses `₫` suffix, `DD/MM/YYYY`, dot-thousands (`1.000.000`); **EN** uses `$` prefix, `DD Mon YYYY`, comma-thousands (`1,000,000`). English-format dates live only in English branches — never leak into a VN branch. Confirmed by scan across all templates.

## Whole-set state audits — language · theme · responsive (each its own pass, Jul 2026)

Owner doctrine: language, theme, and responsive each get their OWN whole-set pass; one clean state is not evidence for another. All three are now race-free, manifest-driven, **all-84** pass/fail gates built on the same pattern — a **fresh single-navigation iframe per template** (reusing one iframe across `src` swaps races the `@import`ed CSS and yields false results), state forced via `__dcSetProps`, settle, then measure:
- **Language** — `_audit/language-overflow.html` — forces `Tiếng Việt`; 0 VN overflow/clip @390; also asserts VN actually applied on every template.

- **Theme** — `_audit/theme-overflow.html` — forces dark; hard gate = dark-applies + 0 dark overflow @390 + 0 open solid-bg leaf-text contrast fails outside `REVIEWED_OK`.

## Theme-overflow contrast is a hard gate (Jul 2026)

`theme-overflow.html` fails `window.__theme.pass` on reproducible WCAG AA fails for leaf text over a resolvable solid background, except templates in the page's `REVIEWED_OK` allowlist (today: three canvas decks whose accent-bright eyebrows on accent-strong sit ~4.22:1 — APCA dark packs still pass; do not retune tokens for that WCAG body near-miss). The walker converts oklab/`color-mix` backgrounds via canvas so element-pack surfaces are not mistaken for the light `body` fallback. Gradients / images / branded washes stay skipped (uncomputable). **Filled CTAs on themeable screens** use `background: var(--cs-accent-strong); color: var(--cs-accent-on)` — dark packs set `--cs-accent-on` to cream for `on/strong` (APCA ≥ 75); cream on `--cs-accent-bright` fails. Light-only print / VN legal instruments stay n/a. Companion proofs: `contrast-guard.html`, `apca-dark-preview.html`, `docs/contrast-report.md`.

## Token exports (Jul 2026)

Machine-readable token exports live in `tokens/`: `tokens.json` (grouped by category + scope-override maps), `tokens.js` (ESM), and `tokens.dtcg.json` (**W3C DTCG** — `$value`/`$type`, CSS-var keys for lossless round-trip to `styles.css`, dark/system + element + expression overrides under `$extensions`; for Tokens Studio for Figma / Style Dictionary). All three are generated from `tokens/*.css` via `tokens.json` — regenerate **all** after any token change (Expansion rule).
